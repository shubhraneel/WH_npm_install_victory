* **Scalability** - MongoDB database is used giving options for both horizontal and vertical scaling. The support of MongoDB Atlas will make managing the scaling easy. 
* **Viability** - The app has been made keeping in mind the quality of the production environment. SEO has been taken care by following SEO friendly practices, for example, uasge of React Helmet.
* **Ease of development** - MERN (MongoDB, Node, Express, React) stack is used which is one the most popular web stack. Addition and editing of features is made easy by a modular design using components and containers and state management with React-Redux. Redux-Saga is used to make API calls and managing their side effects easy. Common components like customized headings, navbar, footer, buttons have been separated for ease of reuse.
* **Ease of updating** - An admin page has been made where data can be easily modified by non-developers. 
* **Separation of responsibility** - State management is done at the container level only and has been separated from Components. Styled Components have been used to separated style from functionality. Styles have mostly been kept away from the container level.
